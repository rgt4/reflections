To będzie placeholder na kolejne refleksje
i nawet pytanka są

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    probably when I would like to share a project among other contributors or with other users, or if I would not have access to my computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Remote repository can be accessed and modified by various contributors. Therefore automatic pull could break functionality at my side.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks, clones and branches may be trickier than they seem. You can clone a fork, however forking a clone seems not be an option. Additonally branches are cloned when cloning or forking. Witchcraft

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    This may become handy when there are several contributors working on the same project or if one is working from different locations to check how different is what I have changed in the project right now.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without using guthub I would probably have to transfer changed files by network, usb keys, cdroms or diskettes (like I used to in former days). Then compare them "by hand".
	With github is easy peasy lemon squeeze, just commit, push, pull, merge, jump :)

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    One can make separate branch whenever he wants. It is especially usefull when there is a new idea to be tested that may break functionality of master branch, that is supposed to be flawless and error free.
